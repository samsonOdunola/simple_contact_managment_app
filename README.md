# Simple Contact Managment App

This is a simple contact managment application interface created using react.

## Features
* **Page Navigation**: This application is comprised of three pages. The navigation is handled by a third party package called react router. This allows user to navigate from page to page seamlesly.

* **State Management**: This application does not use any state managment so data is stored on the browser and is cleared after reloading. In a more sophisticated version of this application, Redux can be used as a state managment tool to ensure data persistence across reloads.

* **Components**: This application has been designed with reusable componets like buttons, navbars and footers.

* **Contact Creation**: Contacts can be created by inuting the contact details and clickiing on the save button afterwards.

* **Editing Contacts**: Contacts that have been saved can also be edited by navigating to the edit page and selecting the contact to be edited. only the first name and last name of a contact entry can be edited.

* **Deleting contact**: Contacts can also be deleted by going to the main page and using the remove button.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
